# Stochastic Gradient Descent

As an exercise for myself, I created this function stored in "main.py" that allows me to execute my own Stochastic Gradient Descent Machine Learning optimiser.

## How does it work?
As an input, the function takes a matrix of explanatory factors as well as the explanatory variable. It additionally needs parameters for the learning rate, the stepsize as well as the minimal learning rate. If requested, the function can be used as a gradient descent or as a _stochastic_ gradient descent, thus randomising the selection of data in each iteration of the algorithm.
